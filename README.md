[Theoretical Part](https://github.com/DG05367/FCUP-SR/blob/main/reports/StateOfTheArtRansomware.pdf) we discuss the state of the art of Ransomware and try to bring awareness to the danger that this malware brings and what can we do to mitigate it's damage.<br>
The [Pratical Part](https://github.com/DG05367/FCUP-SR/blob/main/reports/POCReportRansomware.pdf) is focused in showing how windows is weak to protect against this attacks, having no mitigation tools against this kind of malware.<br>
