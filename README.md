This project was developed in scope of Network Security subject. The project is divided into two parts, the theoretical part and the pratical part.<br>
In the <a href="https://github.com/DG05367/FCUP-SR/blob/main/reports/StateOfTheArtRansomware.pdf" target="_blank">Theoretical Part</a> we discuss the state of the art of Ransomware and try to bring awareness to the danger that this malware brings and what can we do to mitigate it's damage.<br>
The <a href="https://github.com/DG05367/FCUP-SR/blob/main/reports/POCReportRansomware.pdf" target="_blank">Pratical Part</a> is focused in showing how windows is weak to protect against this attacks, having no mitigation tools against this kind of malware.<br>
